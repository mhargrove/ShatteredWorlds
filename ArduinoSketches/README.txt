Libraries contains appropriate libraries for accelerometers. 

ModStandardFirmata contains a modified version of the Standard Firmata
intended to be used with Uniduino. This is NOT working as of now. 

RedBotAccel contains sketch intended to be used with SerialPort in
Unity. 

I2C_Scanner contains a sketch which scans I2C devices. This is useful to test if 
multiple sensors, accelerometers in our case, are connected. It also gives the 
I2C address of each device. 

MultiAccel contains sketch that reads two different accelerometers, the RedBot Accel-
meter and the MPU6050 Accelerometer, and sends data both to Serial.
